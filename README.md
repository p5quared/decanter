Autolab from the CLI. Decan't you see why that's awesome?

## Installation
`brew install p5quared/decanter/decanter`
or build from source via `go install`.


## Usage

To view an overview, use `decanter -h`.

Some examples are:

* `decanter list me`

## Notes

This tool was constructed at a feverous pace by one whom many
might refer to as a ravenous madman. If you find issues
or have suggestions, I'd love to hear about them in the
Github issues section.

I'd also appreciate contributions. If you'd like to contribute,
please email me or write an issue first. There's also a long
list of TODO's that I have written down and scattered throughout
the code.

At some point I'll be cleaning up the Autolab API and publishing
it as a standalone library.
